1 - Setup your CUDA Path
2- source export.sh before execution or update your library path
3- To execute the code: ./bin/chop.out --size=15 --initial_depth=7 -nl1

-Size may vary from 12 to something around 22, which might take a lot of time to complete.
-Initial depth controls the granularity of the subtrees -- recomend from 5 to 8.
- 

4- To execute the multicore version:
./bin/chop.out --mode="mcore" --size=15 --initial_depth=6 --lchunk=32 -nl1

5 - To execute the serial version:
./bin/chop.out --mode="serial" --size=15 --initial_depth=6 -nl1
